# Ably Engineering

_[Ably](https://ably.com) is the platform that powers synchronized digital experiences in realtime. Whether attending an event in a virtual venue, receiving realtime financial information, or monitoring live car performance data – consumers simply expect realtime digital experiences as standard. Ably provides a suite of APIs to build, extend, and deliver powerful digital experiences in realtime for more than 250 million devices across 80 countries each month. Organizations like Bloomberg, HubSpot, Verizon, and Hopin depend on Ably’s platform to offload the growing complexity of business-critical realtime data synchronization at global scale.

## Overview

[![Check](https://github.com/ably/engineering/actions/workflows/check.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ably/engineering/actions/workflows/check.yaml)

This repository is being incubated by the SDK Team at Ably as our new, open home for communicating our ways of working.

## Contents

- [Experts: Expectations](experts/expectations.md)
- [SDK Team Standards and Best Practices](sdk/)

## Why does this site exist?

One of Ably’s core values is being “Open for all”.  We believe that when we’re open, we’re better collaborators, communicators and creators. Whether open source, standards, or protocols, open hearts, minds, and eyes. It’s better when it’s open.

As such, Ably will over time, where practicable, start publishing content that sits within our private knowledge sharing platforms here in an open and public platform.

We welcome input and feedback. Please do reach out.
